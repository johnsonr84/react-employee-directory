  ## Description 
  React Employee Directory uses React Hooks to filter and sort employees by name and other categories.
  The app's UI is broken up into components, managed by state and responds to user events. 

  ## UserStory 
  
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
  so that I have quick access to their information.
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), 
  when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

  The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
